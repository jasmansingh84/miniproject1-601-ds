## How the usage of Git, Docker, Automated Testing, and Continuous Integration can improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company ?

As more software development teams aim to meet the growing demand for faster release cycles and increased software quality, many are looking to implement a continuous development pipeline to streamline their process. Adopting Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery practices enable teams to adapt their software on-demand to meet user feedback, market shifts, and any adjustments to the overarching business strategy (i.e., changes to the requirements).Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers. Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code. Finally, sometimes several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important.

Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly. Continuous integration removes one of the biggest barriers to frequent deployment. Frequent deployment is valuable because it allows your users to get new features more rapidly, to give more rapid feedback on those features, and generally become more collaborative in the development cycle. This helps break down the barriers between customers and development - barriers which I believe are the biggest barriers to successful software development.


### While there is no definitive Continuous Integration /Continuous Delivery pipeline structure, it is typically broken down into the following stages:

* __Commit & Build:__ When developers are finished making changes to an application, they commit their code to a shared repository like Git which will then integrate their snippet with the central code base. The piece of software, or the new feature, is then built from the extracted code and unit tested. CI plays an essential role in streamlining this process by automating each step after the code is written.


* __Automated Testing:__ Once the new piece of software is developed, it needs to be built and then thoroughly tested to ensure it meets all the initial requirements. There are various automated testing tools like Selenium ,Mocha etc that can be used to ensure an application looks and behaves as expected and covers everything from functional tests to performance tests. During this stage, it’s essential to test the entire system in environments that are similar to the production environment because the success of the software depends on it working in the environments your end users are accessing it on.

* __Deployment:__ In the final stage, the built piece of software is rolled out into production. CD requires this process to be automated, which ensures a reliable delivery to users. This is where Docker comes in, Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.


### Here are five aspects of using Git, Docker, Automated Testing, and Continuous Integration that provides companies a competitive edge :


**1. Faster Release Cycles:** Speeding up the build and deploy cycle will allow you and your team to get new features into production quicker, meaning you can get your product into the hands of your consumers faster.

**2. Reduced Risk:** The ultimate goal of a continuous delivery process is to make each release a less-dramatic and painless experience for both the QA teams and customers. By releasing new updates or features continuously, you reduce the risk of bugs ending up in production and can resolve any found deficiencies faster.

**3. Lower Costs:** Adopting a continuous development model will lower your costs by eliminating many of the fixed costs associated with building and testing changes to the application. For example, automated environment provisioning will reduce the costs associated with maintaining your own test infrastructure. Parallel testing will cut down on the number of machines you need to run your tests on. By continuously committing your code, you’ll spend less time (and therefore money) on fixing bugs.

**4. Higher Quality Products:** A major fear of implementing the CI/CD pipeline is foregoing quality for speed, but this isn’t the case. Continuous integration enables stronger collaboration between developers, meaning bugs are found and fixed faster earlier in the development process. Running automated regression and parallel tests will improve test coverage, ensuring your application is bug-free and works across a wider range of environments. Continuously delivering smaller updates to your software will make most changes (and bugs) undetectable to the end user, resulting in happier customers.

**5. Better Business Advantage:** Moving to a continuous development model gives your team the flexibility to make alterations to your software on-the-go to meet new market trends and user needs. You’ll be able to meet rapidly changing demands and will turn your release process into a competitive advantage.
