When starting out with linux, there are some basic commands everyone should know.

 **1. cd - change directory**

cd followed by a directory or file path will take you inside that directory(folder).
 
  **2. mkdir - make directory**

This command, followed by the name you wish to name your directory, creates a new directory. mkdir folder1 will make a new directory called folder1.
 
 
 **3. cp **
 
 **4. pwd**
 
 - path

Type pwd to display the path to your current directory.
 
 **5. mv**
 
 - move

Use the mv command to move files through the command line. We can also use the mv command to rename a file. For example, if we want to rename the file “text” to “new”, we can use ‘mv text new’.
 
 **6. rm**
 - remove

This command removes files, not directories. rm file.txt will remove the file named file.txt as long as it exists and is in the current directory.
 
 **7. history**
 
 **8. Home directory and ~**
 
 **9. file paths in linux **
 
 **10. Using the tab key to complete file paths**
 
 **11. Using up and down arrow for history**
