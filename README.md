# miniproject1-601-ds
For Mini Project 1, create a single repository and elect one person to merge pull requests as the team leader.  Make at least 10 substantive commits per group member that are marked "feature".  Any fixes to "features" must be marked as fixes and do not count.  Commits for creating files or renaming files or other non-feature work should be named "task".
