#Working with more than 2 developers and Its workflow:##On Github we have a master branch and a dev branch* The master branch is the same as production or contains deployment ready code* The dev branch is ahead of master and contains all new code currently being worked on* Locally we three work on the dev branch and push to github when something is ready* The other dev fetches any new changes from the dev branch before pushing his new code* When dev branch is good,we merge with the master branch* Locally we have several feature branches issue branches etc.
