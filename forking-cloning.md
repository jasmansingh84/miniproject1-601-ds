#Basic Difference in Simple Phrases

#Forking

 

##A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. A forked repository differs from a clone in that a connection exists between your fork and the original repository itself. In this way, your fork acts as a bridge between the original repository and your personal copy where you can contribute back to the original project using Pull Requests.

 

##Forking a project is as easy as clicking the Fork button in the header of a repository. Once the process is complete, you'll be taken right to your the forked copy of the project so you can start collaborating!

 



 

#Cloning

 

##When you create a new repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote location where your project is stored. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer so that you can sync between both the local and remote locations of the project.

 

## Unlike forking, you won't be able to pull down changes from the original repository you cloned from, and if the project is owned by someone else you won't be able to contribute back to it unless you are specifically invited as a collaborator. Cloning is ideal for instances when you need a way to quickly get your own copy of a repository where you may not be contributing to the original project.
